# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Apex Orbit Framework (AOF)! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/mouttaqui/AOF/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features to AOF, please include tests.

## Where do I go from here?

For any questions, support, or ideas, etc. [please create a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mouttaqui/AOF/discussions/new/choose). If you've noticed a bug, [please submit an issue][new issue].

### Fork and create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork AOF and create
a branch with a descriptive name.

### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes. Feel free to ask for help.

### Create a Pull Request

If your changes look good and tests are passing, you are ready to create a pull request.

Github Actions will run our test suite.

## Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if: CI is passing, approved by another maintainer and is up to date with the default branch. Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.
