# Apex Orbit Framework (AOF)

The Apex Orbit Framework (AOF) is a lightweight, scalable, and easy-to-use Salesforce Apex framework designed to streamline and standardize Apex development. It adheres to the principles of Separation of Concerns, promoting maintainability, testability, and reusability of code. AOF is built to be generic, supporting any Salesforce SObject, and is optimized for large-scale deployments, particularly those with 10,000+ users, by placing a strong emphasis on bulkification and efficient processing.

Key features of the AOF include a single trigger per SObject pattern, a robust and decoupled error handling mechanism utilizing Platform Events and a custom logging SObject, and a clear, layered architecture. While inspired by established patterns like those found in fflib (e.g., Domain, Selector, Unit of Work), AOF is a custom-built solution tailored for ease of use and performance in demanding Salesforce environments. This framework aims to provide developers with a solid foundation for building complex business logic while adhering to Salesforce best practices and governor limits.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, using, and extending the Apex Orbit Framework.
